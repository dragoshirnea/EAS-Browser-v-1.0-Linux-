      In the graph it is presented the variation of azimuth angle with geomagnetic angle [6,7]. Calculations were made for the Earth magnetic filed in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to φ = 0 degrees and θ = 54 degrees , for different zenith angles. For an 180 degrees azimuth, geomagnetic angle is maximum.
     At high values of α, the geomagnetic effect dominates.
     It follows that for an 180 degrees azimuth the geomagnetic effect reaches its maximum, and at 0 and 360 degrees there is a low geomagnetic effect.
     Also it is shown in the graph that geomagnetic angle increases with zenith.

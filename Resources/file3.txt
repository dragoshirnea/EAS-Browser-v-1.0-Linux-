     Extended Air Shower (EAS) is developed by the cascading interactions of the primary cosmic particle with the nuclei of the Earth’s atmosphere. As a result, the initial particles are converted into other particles (electrons and muons) of detectable energies.
     These last particles reach the ground distributed over a large area from the shower axis.
The higher the primary particle energy and the heavier its mass, the larger the lateral particle distribution.
     This lateral distribution carries some information about the energy and the mass of the primary particles. It can be described with the NKG (Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen) parametrisation
     The graph presents the NKG parametrisation [4] as a function of radius. It can be noticed that NKG decreases exponentially with radius, so we can deduce that most of the particles distribute up to a 100 m distance from shower axis.

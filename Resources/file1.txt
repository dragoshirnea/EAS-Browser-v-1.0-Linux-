Shower age [2]
-parametrizes the longitudinal air shower development
-the shower commences at s=0 and build its maximum development at s=1

   As we can see in the graph, shower age is proportional to atmospheric depth [1]. “Shower age” denotes the amount of interactions, so the number of resulted particles, and as it goes deeper in the atmosphere there will be more developed particles.

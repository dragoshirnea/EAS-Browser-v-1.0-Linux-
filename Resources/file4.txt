      The Molière radius [5] gives the scale of the transverse dimension of the fully contained electromagnetic showers initiated by an incident high energy electron or photon. The theoretically motivated values of s=1 for the shower maximum was used.
      In the graph is presented the variation of Moliere radius with the height.
      The Moliere radius increases exponentially with altitude.
      This means that shower broadens higher upp in the atmosphere.

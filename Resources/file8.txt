    The graph displays the relation between lg|Ratio| [8.d] and azimuth angle. For ratio>0 dominant detection comes from NS polarization component, and for ratio<0 dominant detection from EW polarization component is expected. It is to observe that for 0 ,180 and 360 degrees azimuth, which correspond to North and South directions the amplitude is zero, direction parallel with the geomagnetic field.
